Step 1. ES6

What are arrow functions in ES6, and how are they different from regular functions?
Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, are a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They use the => ("fat arrow") syntax and are often shorter than traditional function expressions. For example, const add = (a, b) => a + b; is equivalent to function add(a, b) { return a + b; }. Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this context; instead, they inherit this from the surrounding scope (lexical scoping). This behavior makes them particularly useful in callbacks and when preserving the context of this is crucial. However, arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and lack their own arguments object.

What is destructuring assignment in ES6, and how does it work with arrays and objects?
Destructuring assignment in ES6 is a syntax that allows extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables in a concise way. With arrays, it works by matching values to variables based on their position, e.g., const [a, b] = [1, 2]; assigns 1 to a and 2 to b. For objects, it matches variables to property names, e.g., const {name, age} = {name: 'Alice', age: 25}; assigns 'Alice' to name and 25 to age. Destructuring can include default values, nested structures, and rest patterns, making it a powerful tool for handling complex data structures efficiently.
Project: Write a function that takes an object with properties and logs each property individually.
Here’s a JavaScript function that takes an object and logs each property individually using a for...in loop:
function logObjectProperties(obj) {
    for (let key in obj) {
        if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) { // Ensures only the object's own properties are logged
            console.log(`${key}: ${obj[key]}`);
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
const exampleObject = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25,
    profession: 'Engineer'
};

logObjectProperties(exampleObject);



Explain let, const, and var keywords. When should you use each?
In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they differ in scope, reassignability, and best practices. var is function-scoped and does not respect block scope, making it prone to unintended bugs due to hoisting and re-declarations. let is block-scoped, meaning it is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it is declared, and is suitable for variables that may need reassignment. const is also block-scoped but creates a constant binding, meaning the variable cannot be reassigned, although objects declared with const can have their properties modified. It’s best to use const for values that should remain unchanged, let for those that might change, and avoid var in modern code to prevent scope-related issues.




What is the spread operator, and how can it be used with arrays and objects?
The spread operator (...) in JavaScript, introduced in ES6, allows you to expand an array or object into individual elements or properties. For arrays, it can be used to create copies, merge arrays, or pass array elements as arguments to functions, e.g., const newArray = [...array1, ...array2];. With objects, it can copy properties, merge objects, or add new properties, e.g., const newObject = {...object1, key: value};. The spread operator is especially useful for immutable updates in functional programming, as it creates shallow copies instead of modifying the original data.
    Project: Merge two arrays using the spread operator
We can merge two arrays using the spread operator like this:
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

How does template literals work in ES6, and how does it make string interpolation easier?
Template literals, introduced in ES6, provide a more powerful and flexible way to work with strings in JavaScript. They are enclosed by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes, allowing for multi-line strings and embedded expressions. String interpolation is made easier with ${} syntax, where expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated and inserted into the string. For example, `Hello, ${name}!` would embed the value of the name variable into the string. This eliminates the need for cumbersome concatenation using + and makes working with dynamic strings much cleaner and more readable.

What are default parameters in ES6, and how do they improve function flexibility?
Default parameters in ES6 allow you to specify default values for function parameters if no argument is provided when the function is called. This enhances function flexibility by reducing the need for conditional checks or manually assigning values inside the function body. For example, function greet(name = 'Guest') { console.log('Hello, ' + name); } ensures that if no argument is passed to greet(), the function will default to 'Guest'. This feature helps write cleaner, more concise code and makes functions more predictable, allowing them to work with fewer arguments or optional parameters without additional logic.

Explain what Map and Set are in ES6 and how they differ from objects and arrays.
Map and Set in ES6 are built-in data structures designed to address limitations of objects and arrays. A Map is a collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any type, including objects, functions, and primitives, making it more versatile than a regular object whose keys are always strings or symbols. A Set is a collection of unique values, ensuring no duplicates, which is different from arrays that allow duplicate elements. Unlike objects and arrays, Map and Set have built-in methods like set(), get(), and has() for Map, and add() and delete() for Set, providing efficient operations and iteration with guaranteed order. They are useful for scenarios where you need uniqueness (Set) or reliable key-value storage (Map).
Project: Create a simple dictionary with Map to store key-value pairs.
Here’s an example of using a Map to create a simple dictionary:
// Create a Map
const dictionary = new Map();

// adding key-value pairs
dictionary.set("apple", "A sweet red or green fruit"); 
dictionary.set("book", "A set of written or printed pages bound together"); 
dictionary.set("car", "A vehicle with four wheels, used for transportation");

// Iterate over the Map 
dictionary.forEach((value, key) => { 
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); 
});



What is the purpose of the for...of loop, and how is it different from for...in?
The for...of loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more, providing direct access to their values. For example, for (let value of array) iterates over each element in the array. In contrast, the for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object or the indexes of an array, providing keys or property names instead of values. While for...in is better suited for objects, for...of is ideal for working with the actual data in iterable objects, avoiding issues like iterating over inherited properties.

Explain the concept of Promise in JavaScript. How do you use .then() and .catch()?
A Promise in JavaScript represents a placeholder for a value that may be available now, in the future, or never, providing a way to handle asynchronous operations. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled (resolved), or rejected. Promises simplify managing asynchronous code by chaining actions with .then() for handling resolved values and .catch() for handling errors. For example, fetchData().then(data => console.log(data)).catch(error => console.error(error)); executes the then block if the promise resolves successfully and the catch block if it is rejected. This improves code readability compared to deeply nested callback functions.
Project: Create a promise that resolves after 2 seconds and logs a message.
Here’s a simple project that demonstrates creating and using a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds and logs a message:

// Create a Promise 
const delayedMessage = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
setTimeout(() => { 
    resolve("This message logs after 2 seconds."); 
}, 2000);
// Use the Promise
delayedMessage
    .then(message => { console.log(message); })
    .catch(error => { console.error("An error occurred:", error); });

What is async/await, and how does it work with Promises?
async/await is a modern syntax in JavaScript for handling asynchronous code, built on top of Promises, to make the code more readable and easier to write. The async keyword is used to define a function that always returns a Promise, and within an async function, the await keyword pauses execution until the awaited Promise resolves or rejects. This makes asynchronous code appear synchronous, improving clarity.
For example, in an async function, const data = await fetchData(); waits for the fetchData Promise to resolve before assigning its result to data. If the Promise is rejected, an error is thrown, which can be caught with try...catch. This eliminates the need for chaining .then() and .catch() methods, simplifying error handling and improving code maintainability.




Step 2. DOM

What is the DOM, and how does JavaScript interact with it?
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or text. The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage dynamically.
JavaScript interacts with the DOM through a set of methods and properties that allow it to access and modify the document’s elements. For example, JavaScript can use methods like document.getElementById() or document.querySelector() to select elements, element.textContent or element.innerHTML to read or change content, and element.style to modify the styling. JavaScript can also respond to events (like clicks or key presses) using event listeners, enabling dynamic updates and interactivity on web pages.

Explain how to select elements in the DOM using methods like getElementById, querySelector, and querySelectorAll.
In JavaScript, we can select elements in the DOM using several methods, each serving different purposes:
getElementById(id):
This method selects a single element by its unique id attribute. It returns the first element with the matching id or null if no matching element is found.
Example:
const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
console.log(element); // Logs the element with id="myElement"
2. querySelector(selector):
This method selects the first element that matches a CSS selector (e.g., class, id, attribute, or element type). It returns the first matching element or null if no match is found.
Example:
const element = document.querySelector('.myClass');
console.log(element); // Logs the first element with class="myClass"
3.   querySelectorAll(selector):
This method selects all elements that match a given CSS selector and returns a NodeList (a collection of matching elements). If no elements are found, it returns an empty NodeList.
Example:
const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.myClass');
elements.forEach(element => {
    console.log(element); // Logs all elements with class="myClass"
});
Key Differences:
getElementById is specific to selecting by id, whereas querySelector and querySelectorAll allow you to use more complex CSS selectors (e.g., classes, attributes, and nested elements).
querySelector returns only the first matching element, while querySelectorAll returns all matching elements.

Project: Create a webpage with a button that changes the color of a div when clicked.
Here’s a simple webpage where a button changes the color of a div when clicked:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Change Color</title>
    <style>
        #colorBox {
            width: 200px;
            height: 200px;
            background-color: lightblue;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="colorBox"></div>
    <button id="changeColorButton">Change Color</button>

    <script>
        const button = document.getElementById('changeColorButton');
        const colorBox = document.getElementById('colorBox');

        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            colorBox.style.backgroundColor = colorBox.style.backgroundColor === 'lightblue' ? 'lightgreen' : 'lightblue';
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
How do event listeners work in JavaScript? Explain addEventListener.
Event listeners in JavaScript are used to execute a function when a specific event occurs on an element, like a click, key press, or mouse hover. The addEventListener method attaches an event listener to an element, specifying the event type and the callback function to run when that event occurs.
Syntax:
element.addEventListener('event', function, useCapture);

'event' is the type of event (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover').
 function is the callback function to execute when the event happens.
useCapture (optional) determines whether the event is captured during the capturing phase or not.

Example:
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
});



What is event delegation, and why is it useful?
 Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where you attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of individual child elements. When an event occurs on a child element, the event bubbles up to the parent, which handles the event. This approach is useful because it reduces the number of event listeners in the document, improving performance, especially with dynamic content that may not exist when the page loads.
For example, if you have a list of items and want to handle clicks on any list item, you can attach the event listener to the parent <ul> element, and then check which item was clicked using event.target. Example:
document.querySelector('ul').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
        console.log('List item clicked:', event.target.textContent);
    }
});
This method is efficient, especially for dynamically added elements, since the parent handles events for all child elements without needing to reattach listeners.

Project: Create a list where clicking on each list item logs its content. Use event delegation
Here’s a simple implementation of a list with event delegation:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Event Delegation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <ul id="myList">
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
        <li>Item 4</li>
    </ul>

    <script>
        // Select the parent <ul> element
        const list = document.getElementById('myList');

        // Add an event listener to the <ul>
        list.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
            // Check if the clicked element is an <li>
            if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
                // Log the content of the clicked <li>
                console.log('Clicked item:', event.target.textContent);
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>

What is the difference between innerHTML, textContent, and innerText?
Here’s the difference between innerHTML, textContent, and innerText in JavaScript:
innerHTML:
i. Returns or sets the HTML content of an element, including any child HTML tags.
ii. Parses and renders HTML, making it useful for inserting HTML markup.
Example:
const element = document.getElementById('example');
console.log(element.innerHTML); // Outputs: <b>Bold Text</b>
element.innerHTML = '<i>Italic Text</i>'; // Replaces content with italicized text
2. textContent:
i. Returns or sets the text content of an element, excluding HTML tags.
ii. Provides raw text without formatting or parsing HTML.
Example:
const element = document.getElementById('example');
console.log(element.textContent); // Outputs: Bold Text
element.textContent = 'Plain Text'; // Replaces content with plain text

3. innerText:
i  Returns or sets the visible text of an element, respecting styles like display: none or visibility: hidden.
ii. May alter the text formatting based on CSS visibility rules.
Example:
const element = document.getElementById('example');
console.log(element.innerText); // Outputs visible text only
element.innerText = 'Visible Text'; // Replaces content with visible text
Key Differences:
1.HTML Tags: innerHTML includes and parses HTML tags; textContent and innerText do not.
2.Performance: textContent is faster than innerHTML because it doesn't parse HTML.
3.Visibility: innerText considers styles like visibility, whereas textContent does not.

Explain how you can manipulate CSS styles of an element using JavaScript.
We can manipulate the CSS styles of an element in JavaScript using the style property. This allows you to directly change individual CSS properties of an element dynamically

Example:

const element = document.getElementById('myDiv');

// Change the background color
element.style.backgroundColor = 'lightblue';

// Change the font size
element.style.fontSize = '20px';

// Add a border
element.style.border = '2px solid black';


How do you traverse the DOM? Explain parentNode, firstChild, lastChild, etc.
You can traverse the DOM using various properties that help you navigate through the parent and child elements. Here are some commonly used properties:
1.parentNode:
i. Returns the parent element of the current element.
Example
const child = document.getElementById('childElement');
const parent = child.parentNode; // Gets the parent element

2.firstChild:
i. Returns the first child node of the element, including text nodes (e.g., whitespace or line breaks).
Example:
const parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');
const firstChild = parent.firstChild; // Gets the first child node (could be a text node)
3. lastChild:
i. Returns the last child node of the element, including text nodes.
Example:
const parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');
const lastChild = parent.lastChild; // Gets the last child node
4.children:
i. Returns a live HTMLCollection of child elements (ignores text nodes).
Example:
const parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');
const children = parent.children; // Gets a collection of child elements

5. firstElementChild:
i. Returns the first child element (ignores text nodes).
Example:
const parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');
const firstElementChild = parent.firstElementChild; // Gets the first child element

6. lastElementChild:
i. Returns the last child element (ignores text nodes).
Example:
const parent = document.getElementById('parentElement');
const lastElementChild = parent.lastElementChild; // Gets the last child element
7. nextSibling:
i. Returns the next sibling node (could be text or element).


Example:
const current = document.getElementById('currentElement');
const nextSibling = current.nextSibling; // Gets the next sibling node

8.previous sibling:
i. Returns the previous sibling node (could be text or element).
Example:
const current = document.getElementById('currentElement');
const previousSibling = current.previousSibling; // Gets the previous sibling node
Summary:
parentNode: Traverse up to the parent.
firstChild / lastChild: Access the first/last child node.
children: Access only child elements (ignores text).
firstElementChild / lastElementChild: Access the first/last child element, ignoring text nodes.
nextSibling / previousSibling: Traverse sibling nodes, including text nodes.

What is the purpose of preventDefault() and stopPropagation() in event handling?
preventDefault(): Stops the browser's default action for an event. For example, in a form submission, it prevents the page from refreshing or navigating to another URL. It is commonly used when you want to handle the event with custom logic instead of the default behavior.
stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from propagating up (bubbling) or down (capturing) the DOM tree. This is useful when you want to stop parent or child event listeners from being triggered by the same event. It does not affect the event's default behavior.

Project: Create a form that prevents submission and logs a message instead.
Here’s a simple form implementation that prevents submission and logs a message:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Prevent Form Submission</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form id="myForm">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <script>
        const form = document.getElementById('myForm');

        form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
            event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the form from submitting
            console.log('Form submission prevented!');
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>



Step 3. BOM

What is the Browser Object Model (BOM) in JavaScript?
The Browser Object Model (BOM) in JavaScript refers to the objects provided by the browser to interact with the browser window and control its behavior. It includes objects like window, navigator, screen, location, and history. These objects allow developers to manage browser-specific functionality, such as:
i.window: Represents the browser window; the global object in JavaScript.
ii. navigator: Provides information about the browser and user agent.
iii. screen: Gives details about the user’s screen, such as resolution.
iv. location: Represents the URL of the current document and allows URL manipulation.
v. history: Enables navigation through the browser's history (e.g., back() and forward()).
The BOM is not standardized but is supported by all major browsers for interacting with browser features outside the document (DOM).

How does window differ from document?
gimme the ans clearly, try to give the answer in a pera
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The window object represents the entire browser window and serves as the global object in JavaScript. It provides access to browser-specific functionalities like controlling the window size (innerWidth, innerHeight), navigation (location, history), and methods like alert() or setTimeout(). The document object, on the other hand, represents the content of the web page loaded in the browser. It is part of the DOM and provides methods and properties to interact with and manipulate the page’s HTML structure, such as getElementById(), querySelector(), or document.title. In short, window is the container for the browser environment, while document is specifically for the web page content.

Explain how localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies work and their differences.
localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies are mechanisms for storing data in the browser, but they differ in scope, storage limits, and expiration:
localStorage:
i. Stores data with no expiration time, meaning the data persists even if the browser is closed or the system is restarted.
          ii. Storage limit: Around 5-10 MB.
          iii. Data is accessible only within the same domain.
          iv. Example: localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
sessionStorage:
i. Stores data for the duration of the page session. The data is cleared when the tab is closed.
          ii. Storage limit: Around 5-10 MB.
          iii. Data is accessible only within the same tab and domain.
          iv. Example: sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
Cookies
i. Stores small amounts of data (around 4 KB) that can be sent back and forth between the browser and server with every HTTP request.
ii. Can have an expiration time set via the expires or max-age attributes.
iii. Useful for session management (e.g., authentication tokens).
iv. Example: document.cookie = "key=value; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 GMT";
Key Differences:
Scope: localStorage persists across sessions; sessionStorage is limited to the session; cookies can be sent to the server.
Size: localStorage and sessionStorage allow more data than cookies.
Use Cases: Use localStorage for long-term storage, sessionStorage for temporary session data, and cookies for server communication or small persistent data.


Project: Store and retrieve user preferences (like theme) using localStorage
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Theme Preference</title>
    <style>
        .dark {
            background-color: #333;
            color: white;
        }
        .light {
            background-color: white;
            color: black;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <button onclick="setTheme('dark')">Dark Theme</button>
    <button onclick="setTheme('light')">Light Theme</button>

    <script>
        // Store user theme preference
        function setTheme(theme) {
            localStorage.setItem('theme', theme); // Store the theme in localStorage
            document.body.className = theme; // Apply the theme to the body
        }

        // Retrieve and apply stored theme on page load
        window.onload = function() {
            const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme'); // Retrieve the theme
            if (savedTheme) {
                document.body.className = savedTheme; // Apply the saved theme
            } else {
                document.body.className = 'light'; // Default theme
            }
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>


Summary:
Storing: Use localStorage.setItem() to save the theme preference.
Retrieving: Use localStorage.getItem() to fetch the saved preference when the page reloads.
Applying: Modify the body or specific elements to reflect the theme.
This allows the user’s theme preference to persist across page reloads.


What is the purpose of the navigator object, and what properties does it have?
The navigator object in JavaScript provides information about the browser and the user's environment. It allows you to access details like the browser's name, version, and platform, and also offers functionality for handling browser features such as geolocation and online/offline status.The navigator object is useful for detecting browser features, platform details, and the user's environment to tailor the web experience accordingly.
Common Properties of the navigator Object:
navigator.appName: Returns the name of the browser (e.g., "Netscape").
navigator.appVersion: Provides the version of the browser.
navigator.userAgent: Returns the user agent string, which contains details about the browser and operating system.
navigator.platform: Indicates the platform or operating system (e.g., "Windows", "Macintosh").
navigator.language: Returns the preferred language of the user (e.g., "en-US").
navigator.online: A Boolean value indicating whether the browser is online or offline.
navigator.geolocation: Provides access to the device's geographical location (via the getCurrentPosition() method).
navigator.cookieEnabled: Returns true if cookies are enabled in the browser, otherwise false.
navigator.hardwareConcurrency: Indicates the number of logical processor cores available.



5. How do window.open and window.close methods work in JavaScript?
The window.open() method in JavaScript is used to open a new browser window or tab, typically with a specified URL, window name, and options (like size or position). For example, window.open('https://example.com', '_blank') opens the given URL in a new tab. The window.close() method is used to close a window that was previously opened by window.open(). However, it can only close windows that were opened by the same script; it cannot close the main browser window or tabs opened by the user directly. These methods are commonly used in pop-up or modal window scenarios.


6. Explain how to get the viewport width and height of a browser window using JavaScript.
To get the viewport width and height of a browser window using JavaScript, we can use the window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight properties. These properties return the dimensions of the viewport, which is the visible area of the browser window, excluding toolbars and scrollbars.
window.innerWidth: Returns the width of the viewport.
window.innerHeight: Returns the height of the viewport.
Example:
const viewportWidth = window.innerWidth;
const viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;

console.log("Viewport Width: " + viewportWidth);
console.log("Viewport Height: " + viewportHeight);




Project: Create a function that logs the window’s size whenever it’s resized.
Here's a simple function that logs the window's size whenever it is resized:
function logWindowSize() {
    const width = window.innerWidth;
    const height = window.innerHeight;
    console.log(`Width: ${width}, Height: ${height}`);
}

// Listen for the resize event
window.addEventListener('resize', logWindowSize);



7. What is the purpose of the setTimeout and setInterval functions?
The setTimeout() and setInterval() functions in JavaScript are used to manage time-based actions. setTimeout() executes a function once after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It is useful when you want to execute something after a certain amount of time has passed, such as displaying a message or performing an action after a pause. On the other hand, setInterval() repeatedly executes a function at specified intervals, making it ideal for tasks that need to happen periodically, like updating a clock or performing repeated actions. The key difference is that setTimeout() runs only once, while setInterval() continues to run at the set interval until it is stopped.

Project: Create a clock that updates every second using setInterval.
Here’s a simple clock that updates every second using setInterval:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Clock</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="clock"></h1>

    <script>
        function updateClock() {
            const now = new Date();
            const hours = now.getHours().toString().padStart(2, '0');
            const minutes = now.getMinutes().toString().padStart(2, '0');
            const seconds = now.getSeconds().toString().padStart(2, '0');
            const timeString = `${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`;

            document.getElementById('clock').textContent = timeString;
        }

        // Update the clock every second
        setInterval(updateClock, 1000);

        // Call it once initially to display the time immediately
        updateClock();
    </script>
</body>

8. How can you detect if a user is online or offline using the BOM?
You can detect if a user is online or offline using the navigator.onLine property from the Browser Object Model (BOM). This property returns a boolean value: true if the browser is online and false if it's offline. Additionally, you can use the online and offline events to detect when the user's network status changes.
Example:
// Check if the user is online or offline
if (navigator.onLine) {
    console.log("User is online");
} else {
    console.log("User is offline");
}

// Listen for changes in network status
window.addEventListener('online', () => {
    console.log("User is back online");
});

window.addEventListener('offline', () => {
    console.log("User is offline");
});


Step 4. Web API & JSON 

What is the Fetch API, and how does it work with Promises?
The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript API used to make network requests (such as HTTP requests) to retrieve or send data from/to a server. It provides a more flexible and powerful way to handle requests compared to older methods like XMLHttpRequest. The Fetch API returns a Promise, which makes it easier to work with asynchronous code.
How it works with Promises:
Promise-based: The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request.
Chaining: We can use .then() to handle the successful response or .catch() to handle errors.
Handling JSON: If the response contains JSON data, you can use the .json() method of the Response object to parse it into a JavaScript object.
Example:
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json(); // Parse JSON data
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); // Handle the data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error); // Handle errors
  });
Explanation:
fetch(): Initiates the request to the specified URL and returns a Promise.
.then(response => ...): Handles the resolved response. The first .then() checks if the response is successful (response.ok), then parses it to JSON.
.then(data => ...): Handles the parsed data.
.catch(error => ...): Catches and handles any errors that occur during the request or data processing.



Project: Fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and display it on the page.
Here’s a simple example to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API (which provides fake data for testing) and display it on the page:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Fetch API Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Fetched Data</h1>
    <ul id="user-list"></ul>

    <script>
        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
            .then(response => response.json()) 
            .then(data => {
                const userList = document.getElementById('user-list');
                
                data.forEach(user => {
                    const listItem = document.createElement('li');
                    listItem.textContent = `${user.name} - ${user.email}`;
                    userList.appendChild(listItem);
                });
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.log('Error fetching data:', error);             });
    </script>
</body>
</html>


2. How does XMLHttpRequest differ from the Fetch API?
The XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API are both used for making HTTP requests in JavaScript, but they differ significantly in their syntax and capabilities. XMLHttpRequest uses a more complex, callback-based approach that requires managing events and the readyState property to track request progress. In contrast, the Fetch API uses a simpler, Promise-based syntax, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations with .then() and .catch() methods. The Fetch API automatically handles network errors through promise rejection, whereas XMLHttpRequest requires manual error handling. Additionally, Fetch API supports modern features like streaming and easier CORS handling. Overall, the Fetch API is considered more modern and flexible, offering cleaner syntax and better support for newer web standards, while XMLHttpRequest is older and more cumbersome to work with.






3. Explain what JSON is and how it’s used in JavaScript.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is used to represent structured data as text in a format that is completely language-independent but closely resembles JavaScript object syntax. JSON is commonly used to send and receive data between a server and a web application. In JavaScript, JSON is often handled using two methods: JSON.stringify(), which converts JavaScript objects into a JSON string for transmission or storage, and JSON.parse(), which converts a JSON string back into a JavaScript object. This makes it easy to work with data in a format that is both compact and easy to process.

How do you parse JSON data in JavaScript, and how do you stringify JavaScript objects?
To parse JSON data in JavaScript, you use the JSON.parse() method, which converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object. Conversely, to stringify JavaScript objects (i.e., convert an object into a JSON string), you use the JSON.stringify() method. Example:
// JSON string
const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';

// Parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript object
const parsedObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(parsedObject.name); // Output: John

// JavaScript object
const user = { name: "Jane", age: 25 };

// Stringifying the JavaScript object to a JSON string
const jsonStringified = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonStringified); // Output: {"name":"Jane","age":25}
Project: Create a function that converts an object to JSON and back to an object.
Here’s a function that converts an object to JSON and then back to an object:
function convertObject(obj) {
    // Convert object to JSON string
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);

    // Convert JSON string back to object
    const parsedObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);

    // Return the parsed object
    return parsedObject;
}

// Example usage
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 28 };
const newObject = convertObject(user);
console.log(newObject); // Output: { name: "Alice", age: 28 }



What is CORS, and why do we need it when making API requests?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent malicious websites from making requests to a different domain (or origin) than the one that served the web page. When making API requests from a web page to a different domain, CORS allows the server to specify which domains are allowed to access its resources.
Without CORS, browsers would block these cross-origin requests for security reasons. This is especially important for protecting user data and preventing cross-site scripting attacks (XSS). CORS headers in the server’s response specify which domains are permitted to access the server’s resources, enabling safe and controlled access to APIs across different origins.
In summary, CORS is necessary to enable secure cross-origin requests from the client-side while maintaining browser security.

Explain how the FormData API works and when you’d use it.
The FormData API is used to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values. It allows you to programmatically build a set of form data, which can then be sent via XMLHttpRequest or fetch() without reloading the page.
You would use the FormData API when you need to send form data asynchronously, such as submitting a form with files, images, or other types of input. It provides methods like append(), delete(), and get() to manipulate the form data.Example:
const form = document.querySelector('form');
const formData = new FormData(form);

// Send the form data using fetch
fetch('/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
});


What is the purpose of the History API, and how do pushState and replaceState work?
The History API allows you to manipulate the browser's session history, enabling you to change the URL without triggering a page reload. It is particularly useful for single-page applications (SPAs) that need to manage navigation and maintain state without full-page reloads.
pushState(): Adds a new entry to the browser’s history stack. It modifies the URL and stores state information that can be accessed later, allowing you to move to a new "virtual" page without actually reloading the page.
replaceState(): Modifies the current entry in the history stack without adding a new entry. This is useful for updating the URL or state information without cluttering the history.
Example:
// Adding a new history entry
history.pushState({ page: 1 }, "Page 1", "/page1");

// Replacing the current history entry
history.replaceState({ page: 2 }, "Page 2", "/page2");
In this example:
pushState() creates a new history entry with a new URL (/page1).
replaceState() updates the current URL (/page2) without adding a new entry to the history.


Project: Create a simple single-page navigation system with pushState.
Here’s a simple example of a single-page navigation system using the History API with pushState():
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple SPA Navigation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#" id="home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#" id="about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#" id="contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    
    <div id="content">
        <h1>Welcome to Home</h1>
    </div>

    <script>
        // Functions to display different content based on the URL
        function loadHome() {
            document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = '<h1>Welcome to Home</h1>';
        }

        function loadAbout() {
            document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = '<h1>About Us</h1>';
        }

        function loadContact() {
            document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = '<h1>Contact Us</h1>';
        }

        // Event listeners for navigation links
        document.getElementById('home').addEventListener('click', function() {
            loadHome();
            history.pushState({page: 'home'}, 'Home', '/home');
        });

        document.getElementById('about').addEventListener('click', function() {
            loadAbout();
            history.pushState({page: 'about'}, 'About', '/about');
        });

        document.getElementById('contact').addEventListener('click', function() {
            loadContact();
            history.pushState({page: 'contact'}, 'Contact', '/contact');
        });

        // Handle back/forward navigation
        window.onpopstate = function(event) {
            if (event.state) {
                if (event.state.page === 'home') {
                    loadHome();
                } else if (event.state.page === 'about') {
                    loadAbout();
                } else if (event.state.page === 'contact') {
                    loadContact();
                }
            }
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>

Explanation:
Navigation Links: The <nav> section contains links for Home, About, and Contact. Each link uses href="#" to prevent page reloads.
Event Listeners: Each link has an event listener attached to it. When a link is clicked, the corresponding page content is loaded (via a simple function), and history.pushState() is called to change the URL without reloading the page.
State Management: history.pushState() is used to add a new entry to the browser history with a custom state and updated URL.
Back/Forward Navigation: The window.onpopstate event listens for changes in the browser history (when the user navigates back or forward), and the appropriate content is loaded based on the state.

8. How can you handle errors in API requests with try/catch blocks and the .catch() method?
You can handle errors in API requests using try/catch blocks for synchronous code or using .catch() for Promises in asynchronous code.
try/catch: Used for handling errors in async functions (with await).
.catch(): Used to handle errors in Promises.
Example with try/catch:
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
}
Example with .catch():
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

9. What are WebSockets, and how do they differ from HTTP requests?
WebSockets are a protocol that provides full-duplex, bidirectional communication channels over a single, long-lived connection between a client and server. Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based and typically opens a new connection for each interaction, WebSockets keep the connection open, allowing real-time communication. This makes WebSockets ideal for applications that require constant, low-latency data exchange, such as chat apps, live notifications, or online gaming.
The key difference from HTTP is that WebSockets enable two-way communication, where both the server and client can send messages at any time. In contrast, HTTP is request-driven, meaning the client must initiate every interaction. WebSockets are more efficient for real-time data transfer, as they avoid the overhead of repeatedly opening and closing connections.

10. Explain the basics of the Service Worker API and its use in creating progressive web apps (PWAs).
The Service Worker API is a JavaScript feature that enables background scripts to run independently of a web page, allowing developers to control network requests, cache resources, and enable offline functionality. Service workers are essential in creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), as they enable key features like offline access, background synchronization, and push notifications. They intercept network requests and serve cached responses when the user is offline, ensuring the app remains functional even without an internet connection. Service workers run in the background, separate from the main browser thread, making them efficient and capable of handling tasks like prefetching resources, managing push notifications, and syncing data when the network is available.
